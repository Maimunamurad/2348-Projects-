6.17 LAB: Password modifier
In this lab, we were told to write a program that takes a simple password and makes it stronger.


6.22 LAB: Brute force equation solver
In this lab, we were told to use brute force to find an integer solution.

7.25 Exact change - functions
In this lab, we were told to write a program that calculates the exact change.


8.10 LAB: Palindrome
In this lab, we were told to write a program whose input is a word or phrase, which outputs whether the input is a palindrome.


9.10 LAB: Word frequencies (lists)
In this lab we were told to write a program that first reads in the name of an input file and then reads the file using the csv.reader() method.


Coding Problem 2

In this coding problem, we were told to write a basic program that performs simple file and mathematical
operations

a.Write a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each
date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following
that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the find() method to
parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line
alone. Use the DateTime module to get the current date. Ignore any dates
that are later than the current date. Output each correct date as:
3/1/1990.

b.After the program is working as above, modify the program so that it
reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” (an Example file is
attached).

c.Modify your program further so that after parsing all dates from the
input file “inputDates.txt”, it writes out the correct ones into an
output file called: “parsedDates.txt”.

Ex: If the input is:
--
March 1, 1990
April 2, 1995
7/15/20
December 13, 2003
May 1, 2023
-1
--
then the output is:
--
3/1/1990
12/13/2003
--
